# We use a specific version of the Go image for stability.

WORKDIR /go/src/github.com/papaburgs/fluffy-robot

# We copy from the specified SOURCE_PATH.

RUN go mod tidy; go mod download


# Build the Go application.
# -o app: Specifies the output executable name as 'app'.
# -ldflags "-s -w": Reduces the size of the binary by stripping debug information and symbol tables.
# CGO_ENABLED=0: Disables CGO, making the binary statically linked and truly independent of the base image.
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -o app -ldflags "-s -w" *.go

# Stage 2: Create the final minimal image
# We use 'scratch' which is an empty base image, containing only the binary.
